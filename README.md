# Car

Inside the Car class, add a method drive_car that sets self.condition to the string "used" and print the condition of the car. Then drive your car by calling the drive_car method. Finally, print the condition of your car again to see how its value changes. Create a class ElectricCar that inherits from Car. Give your new class an __init__() method of that includes a battery_type member variable in addition to the model, color and mpg. Then, create an electric car named my_car with a "molten salt" battery_type. Supply values of your choice for the other three inputs (model, color and mpg). Inside ElectricCar add a new method drive_car that changes the carâ€™s condition to the string "like new". Then, outside of ElectricCar, print the condition of my_car. Next, drive my_car by calling the drive_car function. Finally, print the condition of my_car again.
